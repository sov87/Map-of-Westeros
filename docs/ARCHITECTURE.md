# Architecture — Map of Westeros

> Inherited from *Map of Middle-Earth* (earthwalker17, MIT) and being rewritten for Westeros. The engine
> contracts below hold unchanged unless a section says otherwise; Middle-earth names in them describe the
> original tuning (Phase 2 retunes the looks, Phase 3 replaces the landmarks). Westeros-specific sections:

## Coordinates & units
- **Map km** `[x east, y north]` on the georeferenced, scale-calibrated official map: all authored data
  (`places.json`, `regions.geojson`, `route.json`, the traced vectors). (Middle-earth: ME-GIS km.)
- **World**: 1 unit = 1 km, origin at the frame centre (world.json `frame`), X east, **−Z north**, Y up.
  `WorldSpec.kmToWorld / worldToKm / worldToUv`.
- **Map uv**: u west→east, v north→south; texture row 0 = north (all baked rasters, `DataTexture` flipY=false).
- **Heights** are world units after exaggeration (`world.json → vertical`): three-band relief (massifs ×12
  with γ 0.8; meso relief ×`detailRatio`; micro relief ×`microRatio` — the "de-spike"), pulled toward the
  unsplit exaggeration inside river-valley bands (`valleyBandKm`); sea level = 0, synthesized + DEM-shelf
  bathymetry below (`seaArtefacts` removes known DEM ridges).

## Core contracts (src/core)
- `SceneState` — complete description of a frame: `t`, `tFx` (effect clock), `tod`, `dayOfYear`, `camera`,
  `lens`, `routeProgress`, `annotations`, `lookOverride`, `weather {cloudCoverage, wind}`, `events`,
  `quality`. Bookmark shots carry their landmark's `lookOverride`. `events` (S4) are named 0..1 channels
  switched by the timeline / a shot (`beacons`, `morgul-beam`): gate-`event` lights and event-bound emitters
  read them; `ShotSpec.events` / `BookmarkDecl.events` set them for stills.
- `Timeline.evaluate(t) → SceneState`. `StaticTimeline` for stills/bookmarks; the film is `FilmTimeline`
  (`'film'`, S5): `compileFilm` of `data/tour/timeline.json` (beats; picture-locked, `status: locked`) and
  `data/tour/route.json` (see Tour). The S3 shot list `data/tour/shotlist.json` (segments, per-landmark role,
  hero / context framing, detail budgets) drives the landmark / bookmark gates; the film check validates its
  segment routes and `--sync-shotlist` writes the compiled film's lengths and mixes back into it.
- Shots: explicit `{position, target, fov, roll}` or `{orbit: {place | targetKm, distanceKm, elevationDeg,
  azimuthDeg, fov, lift, aimKm [east, north], roll}}` (src/camera/shots.ts). Landmark bookmarks
  (`<id>-close` hero, `<id>-wide` context) carry tod, dayOfYear, weather, fStop, compare, note and the
  landmark's lookOverride.
- `System { id, init?(ctx), evaluate(frame), dispose? }` — `evaluate` must be a pure function of
  `frame.state` + static data (random access to any frame). Stateful sims are documented exceptions that
  pre-roll from shot start.
- `rand(seed, id, k)` / `hash32` / `halton` — stateless randomness only.
- Quality tiers `preview | review | final` (`src/core/quality.ts`): pixel ratio, spp, terrain patch grid,
  shadow map, density, `terrainDetail {size, layers}`, `atmosphere {inScatter}`, `clouds {shadows, layer}`.
- `Engine.renderAccumulated(stateAt, spp)` — jittered sub-samples (Halton), optional sub-frame time
  (motion blur), running average in HDR, then one post pass. **Lens (S4, render/lens.ts):** depth of field by
  aperture jitter — after `applyState` (systems and LOD keep the pinhole camera) each sub-sample moves the
  camera over a Halton(5,7) aperture disc with a compensating view offset (the focus plane stays fixed);
  aperture = K·F/N with the blur at infinity capped at 0.3 % of frame height; active only at `fStop < 22` and
  spp ≥ 8 (`DEEP_FOCUS_FSTOP` 22 is the default: wides, QA at spp 4 and the explorer stay pinhole). Close
  heroes carry their f-stop on the bookmark. The bigatures were shot deep-focus: keep DOF very subtle.

## World services (src/world)
- `HeightField` — **the only height API**: `sample`, `normal`, `rangeMinMax` (culling bounds), `raycast`,
  GPU `texture` (R32F linear), and `setStamps(stamps)` (TypeScript stamp layer; no re-bake needed).
  **River guard ("rivers win")**: after stamps are composited, the channel core keeps its baked height; under
  the rest of the ribbon the ground stays between the baked bank and the water, and beyond it stamped terrain
  is clamped to the water level ± a natural bank (`world.json rivers.stampBankSlope`) — no blend back to baked
  walls. `places.json onRiver` landmarks are exempt; `stampLoss()` reports how much of each landmark's stamp
  the guard removed (validated in `pnpm check`).
- Stamps (`stamps.ts`): `flatten | raise | cone | plateau | carve` and (S3) `ridge | scarp | massif | basin`
  — declared as data by landmarks, relative to the landmark's base ground (a cone's / massif's profile
  applies to the height above `base`; `flatten lowerOnly` only cuts ground above its target, e.g. the
  Osgiliath terrace). `ridge` (polyline crest, per-vertex heights, round/sharp profile, asymmetry),
  `scarp` (one side raised into a plateau with a steep face), `massif` (mountain body with arête-to-shoulder
  spurs + side ridges, dome, flank slope, crater, `snowCap`; never lowers), `basin` (flattened floor + rim).
  `rough` (deterministic value noise; octaves < 1.6 km dropped) on raise / cone / v2 kinds; `surface:
  'turf' | 'rock'` overrides the stamp-turf mask (groundMaps `surfaceOverride`). **Resolution rule:** the
  heightfield is 0.4 km/texel — stamps shape forms ≥ ~1.2 km; sheer faces narrower than that are kit
  `cliff` geometry seated on the stamp; beside rivers, walls are raised, never carved below the water.
- `World.places` — `places.json` resolved to world coordinates (display = canonical + `displayOffsetKm`).
- Mask textures (RGBA8, linear): `water` (riverChannel, lake, land, riverValley), `landcover` (forest,
  wetland, vulcanism, road), `forests` (mirkwood, fangorn, lorien, oldForest), `look` (array texture: 4
  region weights per layer, order = `manifest.files.look.regions`; uncovered weight belongs to the default
  region), `terrainMask` (2000×1200: ao, valley/TPI (0.5 flat), wetness, log flow accumulation).
- `World.rivers` — `rivers.json` v2: processed centrelines (0.25 km) with per-point `level[]`/`bed[]`
  (monotone downstream except at declared `falls`), `id`, `into` (parent line or lake), per-line flow width.
  Built by the bake's river DAG (hydro.py/profiles.py/snap.py): topology from sinks, stems through lakes,
  **thalweg snap** (Viterbi path over lateral offsets toward the DEM valley floor within a class window,
  `world.json rivers.snap`), pit closing, expectile-isotonic profiles, bank spill cap, clipped confluences,
  edge-bounded carve walls + capped levee, band marsh fills that follow the river level, lake levels solved
  in stems with deltas/lips at the shore. Every gate the bake reports lives in `report.json`.
- `src/world/fields.ts` — the shared Shire/Bree field lattice and `fieldWeightAt` (noise-frayed patchwork
  rule) used by both the hedgerows and the terrain's field colouring.

## Materials (src/materials)
- `env` (environment.ts) — shared uniforms (sun/moon/sky/night/golden/wind/cloudCoverage/cameraPos/tFx, air
  density/falloff/extinction, hazeRamp, cloudShadow…). Written only by `EnvironmentSystem`; animated shaders
  use `env.tFx`, never TSL `time`.
- `atmosphere` (atmosphere.ts) — **the shared aerial perspective**: `scene.fogNode = atmosphere.fogNode()`;
  per-channel extinction + sun-phase in-scatter from a sky-radiance LUT, distance-ramped (`env.hazeRamp`:
  near field clear, depth grows with distance), height falloff, y < 0 clip (slab/void in clear studio air),
  regional haze from a CPU-built texture (`bindWorld`: region weights × `looks.json atmo` + place spots),
  sampled ALONG the ray (end point, mid point in review/final, and the eye as a CPU uniform, weighted by
  height) so a Mordor eye hazes the world beyond; `env.hazeRamp` is written per frame by RegionLook from the
  focus-blended `atmo.ramp` (distances scaled with the focus distance; overviews ≈ S3) and `env.hazeGain`
  adds "film air" to mid / regional shots (< ~320 km focus). **atmo2** (S4, 256×154 RGBA8, same LookField
  weights): R ash-deck cover, G valley-floor height /64, B valley-mist gain /3, A cloud-cap boost. Under a
  deck an **ash layer** (`rayDeck`, focus-scaled ramp) thickens the haze and, with the eye under the deck,
  the in-scatter converges on the overcast colour `env.deckSky` (terrain haze and the overcast dome share
  it: no horizon seam). **Valley mist** (all tiers) is a layer on the valley floor (atmo2.G), gated by
  `max(golden, 0.8·twilight, 0.5·night·moonIllum)` × atmo2.B, lit as pale mist in the regional chroma (the
  Morgul vale stays green), and framed out of wide shots (`mistVis`). The water material uses the same
  functions.
- Ground look (looks.ts): `LookField` — one shared CPU region-weight field (multi-scale warp + noise dither,
  per-region `ecotone` width) used by the ground look, the regional haze and the field fringe, released after
  init. `groundLookTexture(world)` bakes it × `looks.json ground` (+ place / km spots) into a 5-layer sRGB array
  texture (grass+dryness, dry+pattern, soil+snowline offset, rock+volcanic, rockiness+wetland cover);
  `groundPalette(tex, uv, explicitLod?)` reads it. `TERRAIN_SHADE`
  and the shared TSL rules (`snowLineAt`, `alpineAt`, `rockAt`, `snowAt`, `coarseGroundAlbedo`) are the single
  source for anything that approximates the terrain (the water's reflected terrain uses them).
- `looks.json` — one key per line per region: `ground` (terrain palette), `grade` (tint, saturation,
  contrast, exposure, lift, redKeep, bloom, spots[] per place), `atmo` (tint, density (> 1 = local haze),
  sky, `ramp` [near0, near1, local0, local1] haze ramp, `mist` gain, spots[] with tint / density / `mist` /
  `cap`), and (S4) `deck` — a region's overcast ash deck: cover, tone, shadow (key-light loss), height,
  topOpacity (seen from above), `glow` {place, color, radiusKm, strength} (Doom's red underglow), spots[].
  Regions without a `deck` line have none (today: mordor at 52, dagorlad at 46).
- Shader code imports TSL through the `tsl` facade (`src/materials/tsl.ts`) — typed loosely on purpose.
- Material families: terrain (terrain/terrainMaterial.ts), water, foliage, landmark structures
  (families.ts), emission sprites (src/emission), particle, text — one factory per family; per-instance /
  per-vertex parameters instead of new materials.
- **Landmark families v2** (families.ts): TWO uber materials for every landmark mesh — `structure`
  (opaque; casts and receives shadows) and `glow` (neither). Family presets are data (`FAMILY`:
  stone, darkStone, weathered, plaster, wood, thatch, slate, roofTile, gold, obsidian, iron, foliage, metal,
  emissive, emissiveGreen, lava, ithildin) packed per vertex: `color` u8×4 = absolute sRGB paint + baked
  hemisphere AO in `a` (→ the material's AO slot only); `surf` u8×4 = roughness, metalness, grain,
  `a` = noise class × 32 + ground-contact term (0..31; class 4 = foliage, 5 = rock: kit cliffs, stone noise
  without masonry courses + the shared strata; 6 = roof: FAMILY slate / roofTile and the house / tower roofs
  ProxyKit.tagRoof marks; 7 = carved: stone without courses or joints, packed by `carvedVertex` for the Blender
  hero statues in model.ts) — for glow: strength/16, gate
  code, flicker. Contact is the only baked term on the albedo (`× mix(1, contact, 0.3)`). Landmark-local
  fwidth-faded noise (≈9, 37, 140 /km) + stone coursing on walls. Glow = paint × strength × gate × flicker
  (gates from env: always · night = clamp(smoothstep(0.2, 0.7, night) + 0.4·twilight) · dusk =
  0.25 + 0.75·max(night, golden) · event = the light's `SceneState.events` channel). **Gates (S4,
  materials/gates.ts)** are ONE table shared by the emission sprites and the glow family: codes night 0,
  nightDim 1 (ithildin), dusk 2, always 3, event 4 + slot (`EVENT_SLOT`: beacons → x, morgul-beam → y of
  `env.vec4 events`), a TSL `gateNode` and a CPU mirror `gateCPU` (spill selection); glow vertices store
  surf.g = code·32 and surf.a = the glow preset's spill albedo (only emissiveGreen: the Morgul skins take the
  green wall-wash spill). Structures, glow skins, terrain, foliage and water add `albedo · spillIrradiance / π`
  (emission spill, see EmissionSystem). `materialFor(key)` resolves geometry keys;
  `familyVertex(fam, paint?, shade?, tint?, glow?)` packs a vertex (also used for GLBs). Specular ambient:
  the scene has no environment map, so `structure` adds a Fresnel-weighted (F0 0.04 → albedo for metals)
  hemisphere sky / ground radiance along the reflection vector (`env.skyColor / groundColor ×
  hemiIntensity`), dimmed by roughness and the baked AO — metals and glossy dark stone keep form in shade.
  **Weathering (S4 W4-S1; review / final only — `structureTier.full`, set by LandmarkSystem.init before the
  first `materialFor`, so preview renders the S3 surfaces):** every built class (not foliage / rock) gets
  part- and district-scale tone (hue drift, grime stains), tonal masonry courses with warped cell edges and
  joints (stone), long rain / grime streak tapers (0.2 / 0.08 km columns drawn only from ~4 px, mean beyond;
  timber at half strength), AO crevice grime away from the foot, a stronger damp contact, and on dark paints a
  pale dust deposit instead of grime; the total darkening is floored (`W.floor`). Roof faces get slate / tile
  courses, moss and dark soffits; thatch bands; wood boards with seams. Roughness / metalness follow the
  weathering AMOUNT (glossy paints keep their gloss), and the specular ambient takes F0 from the weathered
  paint. All cells are footprint-faded (`vis()`); `WEATHERING_ON` and the `W` constants live in families.ts.

## Systems (registration order in src/app/boot.ts)
1. `EnvironmentSystem(world)` (environment/) — time of day → keyframed daylight (by sun elevation), own TSL
   sky (Preetham port + twilight/night layer, sun/moon discs, deterministic stars, studio-lit void backdrop
   below the horizon), the aerial perspective, one shadow light (sun → moon handover at −4°) with a
   slab-clipped, size-quantized, texel-snapped soft PCF shadow (re-rotated per accumulation sample).
   **RegionLook** (regionLook.ts): the post grade is a pure function of the camera focus — region weights
   sampled on the CPU over a disk around the target, blended `looks.json grade`, `lookOverride` honoured,
   no temporal smoothing. **Film grade (S4, PostPipeline):** one post pass — bloom → halation (warm fringe
   keyed on the bloom's red) → glow key → tint / lift → saturation (redKeep, glowKeep, `greens`, `warms`) →
   `greensHue` (yellow-green pull) → contrast → split-tone × highlight gain × toe (black point with a floor) →
   vignette → night compress → AgX → dither → film grain (final tier only, seeded by pixel and frame). Grade
   fields: `split {shadow, highlight, amount}`, `greens`, `greensHue`, `toe`, `halation`, `highlights` (day
   only, faded between 50 and 250 km camera distance), `warms`; spots inherit their region's film fields. **Cloud shadows** (clouds.ts): deterministic world-XZ field scrolled by
   `weather.wind × tFx`, coverage from `weather`, applied through the key light's `colorNode`, slab top only;
   the key loses `max(cloud·cloudShadow, atmo2.R·deckShadow)` (overcast light under a deck, all tiers).
   **Visible clouds** (S4, cloudLayer.ts): the **ash deck** — a static 4 km grid mesh at the deck height
   (CPU-baked cover / tone / height / glow per vertex, renderOrder 30 below the emission sprites, all tiers,
   1–2 cloud taps): a steel-grey mottled underside lit by transmitted key + grey sky + ground bounce and the
   windowed Gaussian Doom underglow (`env.deckGlow`, strongest at dusk / night), a charcoal top that fades to
   `topOpacity` from above and near the focus (Mordor stays readable in overviews); it fogs itself so the glow
   survives the haze. **Cumulus** (review / final, `quality.clouds.layer`): a sheet at `env.cloudHeight` from
   the same cover field as the shadows (clouds sit over their shadows), faded at grazing angles, at night,
   under decks and with the focus distance. Under a deck (RegionLook's focus cover) the hemisphere sky colour
   turns to the deck tone, the fill rises, and the dome becomes an overcast ceiling with no sun, moon or stars.
   Night (S4): moon key 1.8·illum^1.3, hemisphere lift 1 + 1.3·night, NIGHT grade +0.4 stops, stars at about
   ¼ of S3 with horizon extinction; W4-S2: moonlit shadows keep a 0.28 floor, a brighter greyer night horizon,
   sparser stars. **Mordor pall (W4-S2):** the deck field fills the gaps between region masks
   (`DECK_GAP_FILL`, Ered Lithui / Ephel Dúath ≈ 0.9 cover) and Nurn has its own deck; camera rays take one
   mid-point ash tap (review / final), a camera under a dense pall sees far haze in the overcast colour
   ramped in over 30–90 km (`DECK_EYE_HAZE`, `DECK_EYE_DIST`) with a far lift (`DECK_FAR_LIFT`), no sun disc
   under the deck (`SUN_DECK_HIDE`); seen from above the deck is shaded as a lit volume (review / final) and
   parts along the line of sight to Doom's summit (`DECK_DOOM_SIGHT`, all tiers); the underglow follows the
   cloud masses (`GLOW_MOD`, S4 C2). `atmosphere.applySplit(from, to, …)` returns T and S from ONE
   evaluation (the effects' per-vertex fog); in preview the deck's haze is per vertex.
2. `TerrainSystem` (terrain/, async init) — one instanced CDLOD draw (root 320 km, 8 levels, morph + skirts).
   Surface pass: 5 shared height taps → normal, slope, curvature; `terrainMask` AO/valley (faded where stamps
   changed the ground); ground look + regional rules (alpine rock, dry-brushed crests, scree, snow v2 with
   aspect and per-region snowlines, volcanic ash/fissures, wetland pools, shores, forest floor, Shire fields).
   S4: rock terms use 3D noise (no smear down the fall line); **strata** (materials/strata.ts — dipping
   world-space bedding at three spacings, hard / soft beds with ledge normals, vertical joints and pinch-outs,
   footprint-faded; also the structure family's rock class so kit cliffs band alike); triplanar sides mirrored
   on negative faces, preview a biplanar hard layer on steep ground (+1 fetch); **volcanic crust**
   (terrain/volcanic.ts, procedural, branch only on near volcanic ground: Voronoi plates and cracks at
   6 / 1.5 / 0.4 km, basalt, cinder near Doom, angular fissure glow round Doom's foot, dim by day); grass hue
   breakup (lush ↔ straw); snow v3 (ragged scoured cap rims, wind scouring, crisp margins); a terrain
   `emissiveNode` = fissure glow + albedo · `spillIrradiance` / π (emission spill hook, emission/spill.ts) and
   the `canopyShell()` hook in the forest-floor block (vegetation/canopyShell.ts). The terrain fragment stage
   samples 15 textures (S4 budget, frozen: 13 S3 + atmo2 + the canopy shell; the WebGPU limit is 16).
   S4 W4-S2: **snow v4** — where snow lies is read from the relief (gullies / couloirs, ledges, the lee side
   of the westerlies; ribs and windward faces bare), a ≈ 300 m lower band, steep faces shed it, a cool tint on
   faces turned from the key; `snowLeeWind` is shared with `coarseGroundAlbedo` (water reflections).
   **Macro relief** (review / final): one 0.42 km fall-line-stretched noise → gully / rib creases as a bump
   (forward-difference gradient) and tone on slopes, faded far (`MACRO.fade`) and near (`MACRO.near`: close
   up the fine rock relief carries the face). **Ragged** grass ↔ rock boundary (noise on the rock rule, its
   ramp steepened). **Fields**: mostly greens with a little straw, soft 0.55 km margins, mow rows along each
   field's long axis. **Lava flows** (`VOLCANIC.flows`, crust branch): each continues a Mount Doom kit flow
   from its toe (the first four rows are `DOOM_PLAIN_FLOWS` from `src/landmarks/mount-doom/flows.ts`, the one
   data table the kit eases its flows onto and the terrain reads — S4 W5) — a crisp molten channel in runs that crust over, a faint spill, lit cracks clustered on the
   flows; the open plain stays dark. Strata contrast (S4 C2): 0.13 / 0.09 / 0.06.
   `groundMaps.ts` builds CPU masks at init: stamp turf/presence (stamped − base), shore bands, the Shire field
   mask (from `fields.ts`). Detail: 6 CC0-derived layers (`tools/textures/prep.mjs` → `public/textures/terrain`,
   luminance-normalised so the palette keeps the hue; preview 512²×4 planar, review 512²×6, final 1024²×6
   triplanar on hard ground, triplanar soft detail in review/final), faded by texel footprint. Missing or
   stale detail fails loudly in capture / review / final (`terrainDetailError`, capture assertion). Raw sources
   live in `data/textures-src` (never shipped; `pnpm data:fetch` syncs + derives).
3. `WaterSystem` (water/) — one material family (presets sea/lake/river): depth absorption, sky+heightfield
   reflection, env.tFx waves, shore foam; sea plane, earcut lakes at manifest levels (+ landmark pools from
   `setPools`, merged into the lake mesh with a `waterPool` attribute), merged river ribbons
   built from the baked v2 points/levels as-is (flat across; whitewater only at declared falls or steep baked
   grades; the v1 heuristic stays as a fallback). Waterfalls → effects (S4). S4: emission spill on the body
   and foam plus `spillGlint` (lights reflect), pools (`waterPool`) with deep scatter (no black slabs), the
   reflected sky and land honour the ash deck (`env.deckSky`, deck shadow) and `env.horizonTint`.
   S4 W4-S1: rivers are calm, flow-aligned slicks with brown-green shallows, a far-water Fresnel floor
   (`farSheen`), a ~2.5 px edge fade (`edgePx`) and a darker, cooler mirror of their banks (`mirrorTint`);
   lakes get a skirt over their whole baked bed (`LAKE_SKIRT_KM`, LessDepth), lakes and rivers are alpha-tested
   (`WATER_ALPHA_TEST`), river ends in a lake run on into it (`LAKE_OVERLAP_KM`, the lake share in
   flowDir.w) and outflows hold the lake level under its visible edge (`OUTFLOW_HOLD`). **Reflection proxies
   (S4 C2):** the HeightField-only march cannot see landmark geometry, so `landmarkReflectors` (pure, world
   space) gives one vertical cylinder per GLB model instance (declared bounds) plus each landmark's
   `reflectors` (local `{at, r, top}` cylinders, e.g. Tol Brandir's body and upper mass in rauros); lakes and rivers test them by exact ray / cylinder intersection in review / final, and a
   proxy in front of the terrain hit mirrors as lit grey stone (`WaterSystem.setReflectors`, before init).
4. `VegetationSystem` (vegetation/) — hashed world-grid placement from forest/look/water masks, forest types
   (Mirkwood, Fangorn, Lórien + emergent mallorns, old, Ithilien groves, deciduous), glades/stands, a Barren
   rule (Mordor, Dagorlad, the Morannon approach, sparse Brown Lands/Emyn Muil), hedgerows on the shared field
   lattice. Every instance is a **cluster of 7 sub-crowns** (10-float records); per-instance LOD (5 levels, a
   single blob below ~5 px), 32 km chunks, near-camera fill band. Foliage material: wrap + translucency +
   per-kind sky fill, micro-structure from a precomputed tileable 48³ foam texture (preview 1 tap, review/final
   2). Note the WebGPU limit of 8 vertex buffers and that `meta` is a reserved WGSL word.
   `setExclusions(circles)` (landmark footprints, several circles per landmark allowed).
   **Authored hero trees** (S3, authored.ts): `setAuthored(trees)` — landmark `AuthoredTree` records
   mapped onto the existing kinds/records (mallorn → tiered Lórien crowns, oak/party → Oak, holly → Dark,
   autumn → Oak in autumn colours, conifer → Generic, poplar/willow → River, scrub → Scrub), emitted as a
   hero list BEFORE the chunks (they win the LOD0 cap; never excluded, barren-ruled or thinned) with a
   dedicated hero trunk geometry (flared, tapered, limbs) at LOD0; `mallornFrame()` gives landmarks the
   trunk / tier geometry to seat flets and lamps. Visible chunks are filled nearest-first.
   **Crown archetypes (S4, archetypes.ts):** the record's shape word packs spread + 2·gapQ + 128·arch (no new
   vertex buffer, still 7 of 8): Canopy 0, Broadleaf 1 (asymmetric lobes, lean, visible trunk), Conifer 2 (one
   record, stacked tapered whorls), Columnar 3, Holly 4, Shrub 5, ConiferStand 6, Cluster 7 (S3 layout: hedges,
   mallorn tiers), CanopyEdge 8 (a forest's standing outer ring, review / final); the vertex stage picks the
   layout per instance and the far blob gets a per-archetype profile. Field / hedgerow trees at believable
   scale (lognormal crown radius ≈ 0.19 km) in copses; forest crowns ≈ 0.2–0.45 km; quality density thins
   counts but never resizes crowns (preview = final). **Tree caps** (`setTreeCaps(landmarkTreeCaps)`,
   treeCaps.ts): placed, forest and authored trees inside a landmark's cap circle stay below its height.
   **Far canopy shell** (canopyShell.ts + shellConfig.ts): a 512×307 RGBA8 canopy colour / cover texture baked
   from the retiring canopy records at placement; the terrain's forest-floor block draws it (the terrain's 15th
   texture) with crown-dome relief (review / final), while Canopy / ConiferStand instances sink into it across
   a band defined in screen pixels (a 0.6 km crown going 9 → 5 px; preview retires at 0.7×); near the camera
   the same sample darkens the floor between standing crowns. Roads fade under the shell.
   **Landmark forests** (S3, forests.ts): `setForests(records)` — landmark `ForestDecl`s (area: circle /
   annulus / polygon / band; density per km²; species mix with crown / height ranges and palettes; stand
   clumping; edge feather; clearings; slope and lowest-ground limits) placed as ordinary coarse instances
   (chunked, LOD-capped, thinned with the quality density), deterministic per (seed, world cell);
   conifers as two-tier firs. Masses of trees go here; `trees` stay for a few characterful individuals.
5. `DioramaSystem` (diorama/) — the slab: strata cut faces following the terrain edge profile (tier-aware:
   the preview variant moves fold/undulation to the vertex stage), glassy sea cross-section, satin-stone
   plinth.
6. `LandmarkSystem` (landmarks/) — realizes the built landmarks (see Landmarks): one group per LOD,
   exactly one visible, chosen per landmark from the projected bounding radius
   `hypot(bounds.r, bounds.h/2) · (H / (2·tan(fov/2))) / max(1, |camera − bounds.center|)` against
   `lodPx` (default [160, 40]); a pure function of the camera (no hysteresis), evaluated per
   accumulation sub-sample. Fixed design scale — never distance-dependent size (S3 readability policy).
7. `EmissionSystem` (emission/) — every landmark `LightRecord` as ONE instanced additive sprite draw in the
   main HDR target (5 vertex buffers, ≤ 4096 instances, depth test on, no depth write, no fog): an
   energy-normalised Gaussian core (σ ≥ 0.6 px, exact per-instance energy) + a per-kind halo, so sub-pixel
   lights stay stable sparkles under jittered accumulation; transmittance `exp(−extinction ·
   atmosphere.opticalDepth)` (no in-scatter squares); capped distance gain for window / lamp / fire; gates
   from the shared gate table (window / lamp / ithildin at night + twilight, fire from dusk, lava / eye / magic
   always, beacons and other `event` lights by their `SceneState.events` channel — see Gates under Materials);
   dynamic sprite lights (the effects' beacon flames / sparks, the film's route head) come from
   `setDynamic(fn(state))`, a pure function of the state re-packed per frame; deterministic `env.tFx` flicker.
   **Settlement aggregation:** a landmark's windows / lamps / fires (per gate) crossfade into one aggregate
   spark at their energy-weighted centroid as the group shrinks below ~12 → 6 px (pure function of the
   camera), with a visibility floor. `gradeUniforms.glowKeep` (RegionLook: 0.9·max(night, twilight)) exempts
   bright glows from the night desaturation and soft-compresses their peak (hue kept); 0 by day.
   `env.pxPerKm` / `env.viewportH` are written by EnvironmentSystem.
   **Emission spill (S4, emission/spill.ts + spillSources.ts):** at init the records become spill sources
   (reach by kind: lava 6 km, eye 4, magic 2, beacon 2, fire 0.8, ithildin 0.4, lamp 0.35; windows through their
   settlement aggregates; explicit `spillKm`; `sprite: false` spill-only sources such as the Morgul wall-wash;
   Doom's crater adds a lit pall source above it). Each frame a PURE selection scores the lit sources against
   the camera focus (energy × gate × reach), keeps the top N (8 review / final, 4 preview, ties by index) with
   weights that fade at the cut (no popping) and uploads `spillU` (pos / col / aux uniform arrays, count,
   haloOn). `spillIrradiance(p, n)` (wrap-Lambert, finite core, windowed at the reach) lights terrain,
   structures, Morgul glow skins, foliage and water; `spillInScatter` adds analytic point-light airlight halos
   for lava / eye / magic / beacons in the shared fog (`atmosphere.apply`) and the dome (review / final only,
   soft-capped: no sun disc); `spillGlint` puts GGX glints of the sources on water. A sprite's extinction
   includes the ash pall along the camera ray (`atmosphere.rayDeck`, eye + mid taps), so Mordor's tower
   lights fade with their towers.
8. `EffectsSystem` (effects/, S4) — realizes landmark `emitters` and waterfalls (`landmarkEmitters`,
   `landmarkFalls`, `pools`) in four draws: **puffs** (smoke / ash / steam / wisp / spray billboards: one
   instanced premultiplied draw, CPU-sorted back to front per frame as a pure function of the camera; render
   order 51 under an ash deck — after the emission sprites, so a plume veils its crater orb — and 29 when the
   camera is above the deck), **falls** (core + veil ribbons with scrolling streaks and plunge foam floating on
   the pool / lake surface, order 35), **mist cards** (3 stacked layers per card, order 34; a `mist` emitter's
   rate is its opacity, scale its half-width, `at → to` its band) and the **beam** (additive camera-facing axis
   billboard, order 52; rate = radiance gain, scale = width). Particles are STATELESS: instance (emitter, k),
   `age = fract(tFx / life + hash)`, the position a preset trajectory of (age, hash, wind) — any `tFx` renders
   in isolation, no pre-roll. Strong plumes rise to and spread under the ash deck (Doom's column lit by a CPU
   copy of the spill on its lower third — keep it in step with spillSources' falloff / flicker); smoke below
   `WISP_SCALE` becomes a thin wisp (chimneys, Isengard's pits); falls ≥ 2 km wide raise a mist column (Rauros);
   event emitters (`morgul-beam`, beacons) follow `SceneState.events`; the beam and beacon fires add sprite
   lights through `emission.setDynamic` (dynamic lights are sprites only — they do NOT spill; the beam's
   wall-wash is a static `sprite: false` spill source gated by its event). Emitter LOD by projected size, counts × quality density; all effect
   pipelines are compiled at warm-up. `tools/check/effects.ts` builds the same records (shared `buildEffects`)
   and checks random access determinism.
9. `RouteSystem` (route/, S5, film only) — the journey's gold line from the compiled route: one ribbon
   (3 vertices across per 0.25 km sample), width expanded in screen space (core half-width ≈ 0.05 km in px,
   clamped 1.6–3.5 px × H/1080), a far / near path morph, a depth pull toward the camera (beats the CDLOD /
   HeightField mismatch) plus a canopy pull (`VegetationSystem.canopyAlong` at boot → per-sample canopy height;
   the vertex slides toward the camera over tree crowns, limited by an 8-step terrain march so ridges still
   hide it), per-vertex atmosphere transmittance. Three draws: dark umber under-stroke (order 20), additive gold
   core + glow with the head comet and a travelling shimmer (21), underground legs as an x-ray of dots (depth
   test off). Revealed by arc length to `SceneState.routeProgress`, × `routeGlow`; the head light is a dynamic
   emission sprite. **Grade keep:** the core / x-ray write `min(alpha, 1 − coverage)` into the HDR alpha and
   the film's `PostPipeline.enableRouteKeep()` (accumulation carries alpha; the grade holds covered pixels at
   saturation 1) — the line stays gold under grades that grey out warm hues (Mordor at night).
10. `TitleSystem` (titles/, S5, film only) — the post overlay (`PostPipeline.overlay`, drawn on the readback
   target after the grade: never tone-mapped, never in still pages). OFL fonts (`fonts.ts`, `FontFace`, awaited
   before `ready`; a missing font fails loudly), CPU-rastered `OffscreenCanvas` cards sized as fractions of the
   frame height (`raster.ts`; place / pass labels at 2× and box-resampled, no sub-pixel sharpness pulse; cards
   released 4 s outside their window and rebuilt identically). Kinds: `title`, `place` (name + subtitle,
   hairline leader + diamond), `pass` (name), `end`, `fade`. `layout.ts` (pure, Node-safe — the film check
   uses it): projection, title-safe clamp, HeightField visibility, mask-based side choice off the subject
   (no compile-time side unless authored); the diamond slides onto the route head while it rests on the
   subject. Reveal = max(the caption's fade, 1.4 / 1.0 s place · 0.8 / 0.6 s pass), capped at 40 / 30 % of
   the window; layout at `SceneState.shutterCentre` (set by film captures on every sub-sample).

**Tour (src/tour, S5 — pure, no render dependencies; Node and the page run the same code).**
`compileFilm({world, landmarks, shots, route, timeline, built}) → CompiledFilm` (stable `hash`; the page passes
the landmark build, so `pnpm check` gates exactly the page's film). `route.ts`: `data/tour/route.json` legs
(place refs with `offsetKm`, `at` points, river / lake boat legs projected onto the centreline / lake level,
underground legs) → centripetal Catmull-Rom, draped on the HeightField's upper envelope, arc length, head marks;
`routeReport` (self-crossings, kinks, float, height steps). `rail.ts`: Gaussian-smoothed camera rails along s
(fine / coarse). `rig.ts` + `curves.ts`: hold keys (bookmark / shot / orbit + `set` overrides, film framings
never edit bookmarks — five are lock sentinels), moves on a van Wijk–Nuij zoom/pan path (per-move `rho`,
`apexEl`, `maxAltKm`), hold drift with C2 blends, baked ground clearance and ash-deck caps, the route head easing
mark to mark with a lead. Slow channels (tod: monotone cubic with linear holds; events; look weight; lens;
captions) are evaluated at the frame time, camera / `tFx` / head at the sub-sample time (motion blur).
`captions.ts` (`captionFades`, anchors at 0.6 × built height or `anchorLiftKm` / `anchorOffsetKm`), `cues.ts`
(the music `CueSheet`), `FilmTimeline.ts` (`Timeline`, registered as `'film'`). **Film-only SceneState
fields** (absent in stills, so still pages stay bit-identical): `lookOverrideWeight`, `lodBias`, `routeGlow`,
`lodDither` (one-sided LOD dissolve across the shutter sub-samples: thresholds × 2^−d), `shutterCentre`.
**Film boot block** (`?film=1`): compile, RouteSystem + TitleSystem, `post.overlay`, `enableRouteKeep`,
`engine.inFrame` (motion sampling ignores the void), `environment.shadow.setMode('smooth')` (continuous key
shadow fit, no texel snap, radial far fade).

## Landmarks (src/landmarks)
`defineLandmark({ id, placeId, tier, headingDeg, scale, anchor, stamps[], proxy(kit), model, lodPx,
lights[], trees[], forests[], treeCaps[], emitters[], waterFeatures[], vegetationExclusion, contrast, lookOverride,
annotation, bookmarks[], cameraConstraints, audioHooks })` (types.ts). S4 contracts (records.ts / world.ts):
lights (decl, kit, record) carry optional `LightExtras {event, spillKm, sprite}` (event channel; spill reach;
`sprite: false` = spill-only source); emitters `{preset: smoke | ash | embers | steam | mist | sparks | beam, at,
to?, rate, scale, color?, event?}` → world `EmitterRecord`s (`landmarkEmitters`), waterfalls / floods → world
`FallRecord`s (`landmarkFalls`), `treeCaps` → world `TreeCapRecord`s (`landmarkTreeCaps`) — pure, usable in Node. Folders are auto-discovered
(`import.meta.glob`). Landmarks never create materials, particle systems or render loops — shared systems
realize their declarations.
- **One pure build run** (build.ts `buildLandmarks(world, defs, {geometry})`, after the stamp layer, before
  vegetation / water init) → `BuiltLandmark` records (records.ts): geometry LODs (`Map<materialKey,
  BufferGeometry>` per LOD), world-space `LightRecord`s (def.lights + kit records; gate by kind
  `DEFAULT_GATE`), `AuthoredTree`s, contacts (seating gate), bounds, stats. `geometry: false` (Node checks,
  probe) builds LOD0 records only. Local-frame helpers in frame.ts; stamps / exclusions / pools in world.ts.
  Kit `proxy` callbacks must not mutate module-level state (the build runs more than once).
- **Kit v2** (kit/ProxyKit.ts, geom.ts, ao.ts): indexed geometry merged per material key per LOD; parts
  placed by base centre; `PartOpts {at, rot, color (absolute paint), shade, tint (legacy), lod, seat, glow,
  grain}`; two random streams (`k.r()` = the author's; kit internals `rand(hash32(seed, 'kit2'), part, k)`).
  Primitives: house (roofs, windows, dig, bank, ridge caps, gable boards), wallPath (crenels / stakes,
  batter, followGround, towers), tower, lathe, extrude, loft, cliff (faceted band, taper, soft), rock
  (leafy crowns for foliage ≥ 0.3 km), mound, scatter, stairs, bridge, arcade; v1 box / cylinder / cone /
  sphere / blob / ring / torus / wall kept. Records: `light`, `windows`, `tree`. LOD membership by
  part-group extent (≥ 8 % of the bbox diagonal → LOD2, ≥ 2 % → LOD1; nested composites join the
  outermost group; LOD1/2 regenerate with ½ / ¼ segments; a level identical to the previous one reuses
  its geometry). Seating helpers sink parts 0.02 km and record contacts (centre, lowest and uphill corners).
- **Vertex AO** (ao.ts): absolute 0.025 km voxels (coarser only past 2.5 M cells), 6 cosine Halton rays ×
  16 steps starting 1.5 voxels out, exact terrain height test (weight 0.5), per-family floors; structure
  geometry only; ≈ 0.3 s for all 24 landmarks at boot.
- **Readability policy (S3):** one fixed design scale per landmark; wide-shot readability from terrain
  silhouette (stamps), value contrast and emission; framing gates in tools/check/bookmarks.ts.
- **Blender GLBs** (close-up heroes only, after the S3 spike): `pnpm models [--only id] [--verify]`
  (tools/blender/run.ts: memory guard ≥ 1.5 GB → the GPU lock → Blender 4.5 headless without a shell, 10 min
  timeout; `--verify` rebuilds and requires identical bytes; `--probe` prints the Blender version and the glTF
  exporter options) runs `tools/blender/<id>.py` (lib.py: 1 BU = 1 km, fixed seeds, remesh / decimate into
  nodes lod0/1/2, materials named `fam:<FamilyId>`, COLOR_0
  paint, no UVs / textures / Draco) → `public/models/<id>.glb` + `public/models/manifest.json` (sha256,
  script hash, tris, bounds). Runtime (model.ts): GLTFLoader → families by material name (unknown names
  throw), COLOR_0 → paint, the kit's packing + AO; GLB materials are never used. `ModelDecl {file,
  instances[{at, headingDeg, mirrorX}], boundsKm}`; Node never parses GLBs (bounds from the decl).
  `pnpm check` verifies manifest sha256, CREDITS coverage and script staleness.

## Capture & QA (tools/capture)
- The readback target stores bytes as-is (NoColorSpace): the post pass already encodes sRGB.
- `window.__mm` (capture mode `?capture=1`): `ready`, `info()`, `render({name, shot|timelineId, t, width,
  height, spp, shutter, fps})` → RGBA readback POSTed to `/__capture/frame`; `benchmark({shotId, frames,
  orbitDeg})` → interactive-path frame latency (diagnostics only); `timelineInfo(id)` → `{id, duration, meta}`
  and `timelineState(id, t)` → the SceneState (S5). With `shutter > 0` the sub-sample times are stratified and
  permuted (`shutterFraction(i, n)`), so motion blur decorrelates from the pixel jitter; stills use shutter 0.
- `pnpm shots --shot <id> | --all | --smoke [--spp n --w --h --tod --quality --determinism --batch k --no-latest]` →
  `renders/shots/<stamp>/` + `latest/`. Shots live in `data/qa/shots.json` + `shots.d/` (explicit camera or
  `orbit`); named sets in `data/qa/sets.json`.
- `pnpm qa --set s1 --batch 8` renders a set in bounded batches (fresh Vite + Chrome each), then composes
  contact / compare sheets (references paired from the local, never-committed `reference/manifest.json` by subject) and an anonymised
  `blind/` set for recognizability critics.
- Heavy-job lock: one machine-wide lock (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\map-of-middle-earth\gpu.lock`, heartbeat) taken by
  captures, `pnpm bake` and `pnpm build` (`tools/heavy.ts`) after a free-RAM guard (`tools/capture/host.ts`);
  orphaned capture Chrome of the checkout is swept while the lock is held.
- `pnpm perf [--gate]` — preview-tier boot/compile/frame-latency probe vs `data/qa/perf-baseline.json`.
  It waits for a quiet host before the boot and each view (background CPU ≤ `--quiet` %, at most
  `--quiet-wait` s) and records `noise` per measurement (NOISY ones are flagged). The iGPU shares the package
  power with the CPU and the laptop has a slow and a fast power regime (~1.7× apart): compare only
  interleaved A/B runs with a rest before each (S4: 90 s), never against a baseline from another regime.
- `tools/capture/probe.ts "<expr>"` evaluates an expression against `window.__app` for diagnostics.
- `tools/capture/exportCameras.ts --set <set> --out <file>` — resolved cameras as explicit shots, so another
  checkout (e.g. the previous session's code) can render exactly the current framings for A/B.
- Reference images are gitignored: agent worktrees set `MOW_REFERENCE_DIR` to the main checkout's
  `reference/`. `qa.ts --blind <set>` picks the anonymised set; bookmark ids `<landmarkId>-<suffix>` pair
  with references by the longest landmark-id prefix.
- `tools/capture/pair.ts --a <run> --b <run>` — blind A/B sheets (left/right shuffled; key outside the folder).
- `pnpm review --from <qa run> [--before <run>] --manifest data/qa/review-v1.json --out review/v1`
  (tools/capture/review.ts, CPU / sharp; these are its defaults since S6, `review-s4.json` is retired) composes a
  session's review stills for the user: numbered stills, labelled day / night pairs, before / after sheets, a
  contact sheet, README.md (what to look at, the critic issue each still answers) and manifest.json (commit,
  tier, spp, sha256). `review/` is gitignored.
  Manifest `before.tag` / `after.tag` label the sheets (default S3 / S4; `review-v1.json`: S4 → V1).
- Shared helpers: `compose.ts` (`labelled`, `sideBySide` / `sideBySideImage`, `size`, `sha` / `shaBuf`) and
  `runs.ts` (`readRun`: a qa run folder, its `shots/` folder or a `pnpm shots` output folder →
  `results[]` from `manifest(-N).json`, later batches win; `chrome`, `info`, `args`). Both have no side
  effects; the CLIs import them.
- `pnpm lock` (lock.ts, CPU only) — the V1 pixel-hash lock: `--write <run> --set lock-v1 [--out
  data/qa/lock-v1.json]` records commit (+ dirty), settings (w / h / spp / tier, consistent across the set),
  Chrome, GPU, the Windows display driver and `shots {id: sha256}`; `--verify <run> [--lock …]` exits 0
  identical · 1 changed / missing · 2 Chrome or driver differ (hashes advisory) · 3 other settings;
  `--compare <runA> <runB> [--only] [--strict]` diffs two runs. Usage errors exit 64.
- `pnpm showcase` (showcase.ts, CPU / sharp) — the README images: `data/qa/showcase.json` (runs `review` /
  `hero`, defaults quality / chroma / budget, images of kind still / pair / social / banner) → mozjpeg
  4:4:4 JPEGs in `docs/images/` + `manifest.json` (commit, sharp / libvips versions, per image size / bytes /
  sha256 / alt / caption / source renders). Titles use only the OFL Cinzel / Cormorant files (checked
  against Pango's fallback; without them the title is dropped). Byte-reproducible; writes only listed files,
  deletes only files its own previous manifest listed, refuses foreign folders; `--dry`, `--snippet`.

- **`pnpm film` (S5; S6 unattended tooling — tools/capture/film.ts + ffmpeg.ts)** — frames of the compiled
  film (`?capture=1&film=1`, timeline `'film'`; frame k shows t = k / fps). One invocation = one bounded
  capture session (`--budget 0`: a series of them, see Unattended runs). ffmpeg / ffprobe come from `PATH`
  (8.x full build) or `MOW_FFMPEG` / `MOW_FFPROBE`.
  - Stills: `--at t1,t2 | --every s [--from --to] | --beats a,b` (`--tier --w --h --spp --shutter --label`,
    `--determinism` re-renders the first still after the batch) → `renders/film/stills-<stamp>[-label]/`
    PNGs + `manifest.json` + `sheet.png` (labelled "t · beat · tod", `compose.grid`).
  - Sequences: `--render [--tier preview|review|final] [--w --h --spp --shutter] [--from --to] [--codec
    x264|prores|ffv1] [--crf --preset] [--chunk n] [--budget s] [--run dir] [--label x] [--force]` streams raw
    RGBA readbacks into one ffmpeg process per chunk (stdin drain back-pressure; no PNGs on disk), BT.709
    conversion + tags (`setparams`). A chunk is encoded into `partial/`, ffprobe-checked (frame count) and
    moved to `chunks/cNNNN.<ext>` with `cNNNN.json` (per frame t, sha256, ms, luma, and spp / motion with a
    ladder; the chunk's Chrome). `run.json` freezes tier, size, spp / ladder, shutter, codec, chunking, frame
    range, film hash, commit, dirty and (S6) `chrome`; a resume keeps the run's settings. Exit 0 = the range
    is complete · 75 = the per-call budget ran out (default 520 s, boot included): run again with `--run` ·
    3 = low memory · 2 = the run refuses · 1 = error. Disk guard: ≥ 2 GB free before each chunk.
    Tiers: preview 960×540 (x264 crf 20 veryfast, 240-frame chunks) · review 1280×720 (x264 crf 14 medium,
    96) · final 1920×1080 (ProRes 422 HQ 10-bit 4:2:2, `prores_ks` profile 3, 48). Adaptive motion-blur
    sampling: `--spp-ladder px:spp,…` (e.g. `12:8,24:12,36:16`; needs a `--spp` below every step) gives a
    frame more time samples when the ground moves more than px on screen while the shutter is open
    (`window.__mm.motionPx`, p90 of a 9×5 ray grid); levels are dilated ±`--spp-dilate` (2) frames and short
    dips filled (pure: from the timeline); the lens keeps deciding on the base spp. Each chunk's spp is
    planned before it renders (budget from wall time per sub-sample × 1.25; a chunk 50 s past the budget is
    discarded). x264: one keyframe per chunk (`--gop`).
  - **Resume refusals** (exit 2 unless `--force`; checked at every session start, i.e. at every Chrome
    restart): another film hash; a commit since the run started whose diff touches the render inputs (`src`,
    `data`, `public`, `index.html`, `vite.config.ts`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`) or `tools/capture` —
    docs-only commits are fine; uncommitted changes in the render inputs (a new run refuses them too); another
    Chrome version than the run's (`run.json` `chrome`; older runs: their first chunk's).
  - **Unattended runs (S6):** `--budget 0` restarts Chrome + Vite when the next chunk's estimate would pass the
    25-min session cap, but only after ≥ 1 chunk in that session (a chunk longer than the cap still renders on
    a fresh session). `MOW_CHROME` (browser.ts; every capture) launches that chrome.exe instead of the
    installed Chrome channel, with the same profile: the final render uses a private copy of the locked
    Chrome 154.0.8037.95 (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\map-of-middle-earth\chrome-154.0.8037.95\`), so an auto-update cannot
    change pixels mid-render. `--render` holds `keepAwake()` (host.ts: a hidden PowerShell child holds
    `SetThreadExecutionState(ES_CONTINUOUS | ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED)` until its stdin closes — on return or when
    the process dies; no idle sleep, the display may turn off, closing the lid still sleeps).
    `tools/capture/film-overnight.ps1 -Run <dir> [-Chrome <exe>] [-FilmArgs:"…"] [-Retries 8] [-WaitS 120]`
    runs `pnpm film --render --run <dir> --budget 0 …` in its own window (not an agent shell), sets
    `MOW_CHROME` from `-Chrome`, holds its own keep-awake across attempts, appends everything to
    `<run>/render.log` (UTF-8) and resumes after a non-zero exit (after `-WaitS` s, up to `-Retries` times;
    never after exit 2). `run.json` wins on resume, so `-FilmArgs` matter only for a new run; bind them with a
    colon (`Start-Process` joins its arguments unquoted).
  - `--verify-resume --run dir [--sample 12]` re-renders the middle frame of `--sample` finished chunks spread
    evenly over the run (the first chunks' first frames are the black fade-in) at the frame's recorded spp and
    compares sha256 (exit 1 if any differs); it runs on the run's Chrome and refuses another (set
    `MOW_CHROME`) unless `--force`.
  - `--assemble --run dir [--audio a.wav] [--mp4 name|abs] [--master name|abs.mov] [--reencode]` (no capture
    session) refuses missing chunks and checks free disk (≈ 1.2 × the chunks' bytes + 1 GB; 2.2 × with
    `--master`), then: concat (stream copy) → `<run>/video.<ext>` → the master first (`--master`, needs
    `--audio`: the chunks' video stream copied + the audio as 24-bit PCM 48 kHz, exact film length; seconds;
    frame count checked) → the delivery mp4: H.264 High (libx264 crf 16 preset slow, yuv420p, BT.709;
    re-encoded for non-x264 runs or with `--reencode`, else a stream copy; ≈ 33 min for the 227.75 s film at
    1080p on the laptop) + AAC 320k 48 kHz (with `--audio`), `+faststart`, exact film length — written to `<name>.part.mp4` and moved
    in once ffprobe confirms the frame count. When both check out the master replaces `video.<ext>` (the same
    stream); `partial/` is emptied. Default mp4 name `journey-<tier>-<height>p.mp4`; relative names land in the
    run folder, absolute paths where they say. A frame-count mismatch exits 1.

## Music (tools/music — Python / uv, CPU, `pnpm music`)
The original score as code. `pnpm music --cues <cue sheet> [--label x] [--from s --to s]` runs under the
heavy-job lock (`tools/heavy.ts music --min-free-mb 1500`), so it never overlaps a capture.
- **Inputs** (`fetch.py`, gitignored `data/music-src/`, committed `manifest.json`): a sparse checkout of VSCO 2 CE
  (CC0, SFZ branch; the clone's `.git` is dropped after checkout) and sfizz 1.2.3 `sfizz_render`. The cue sheet
  comes from `node --import tsx tools/check/film.ts --cues <file>` (`CueSheet`: film {duration, fps, hash},
  sections, cues per beat {t0, t1, mood, intensity}, hits); event ramps (beacons, beam) are read from
  `data/tour/timeline.json`, so the score re-fits when the picture is re-timed.
- **Score** (`journey.py`): sections read beat times from the cues (`Cues.t0 / t1 / event_ramp`, `Grid` for metric
  passages) and write notes into a `Score` (`engine.py`: per-instrument notes, gain / send envelopes in dB, a hall
  wetness envelope, the conductor's `arc` bus envelope, markers). `instruments.py`: the orchestra table
  (sfz, range, pan, gain, hall send, latency, family) and the project's own percussion SFZ maps.
- **Render**: humanised timing / velocity, re-bowing of long notes (strings 5 s, brass / winds 3.8 s — the
  samples are not looped) → one MIDI file per stem (1920 ticks / s) → `sfizz_render` (48 kHz, 3 workers).
  Per-instrument calibration to −20 LUFS at velocity 96 (cached by SFZ hash in `data/music-src/calibration.json`)
  keeps stems comparable without normalising away dynamics.
- **Mix / master**: equal-power pan, synthetic stereo hall IR (band-wise decay, early reflections; no third-party
  IR) on sends via `oaconvolve`, the `arc` bus gain, end fade; 28 Hz high-pass → deterministic stereo-linked glue
  compressor (2:1 above −24 dB) → integrated loudness −16 LUFS → own look-ahead limiter → true peak ≤ −1.5 dBTP.
- **Outputs** `renders/music/<stamp>-<label>/`: `master.wav` (48 kHz 24-bit), `stems/`, `spectrogram.png`
  (section markers), `report.json` (LUFS, true peak, per-section loudness, stem peaks, note counts, cue hash).
  Deterministic for a given cue sheet, score code and sample set.

## Validation (tools/check, CPU only)
- `pnpm check` (run.ts): places/footprints, landmark definitions, assets vs CREDITS (incl. derived detail
  layers), and on the baked world (honours `MOW_WORLD_DIR`): river levels monotone except at falls,
  continuation continuity, rivers win over stamps, per-landmark stamp loss, and the bake's hydro report gates
  (report.json) expressed as visible-defect budgets (core raise, carve lowering by band, marsh / lake-rim
  areas and a fixed fill-depth cap, ribbon-edge float, new steep steps, source trims).
- `tools/check/geometry.ts` (`MOW_BASELINE_DIR`): coast IoU, lake wetted areas, channel alignment, landmark
  ground and named-peak changes, snowline/treeline area moved, steepness — vs a frozen bake.
- **Landmark gates** (tools/check/landmarks.ts) — per landmark LOD0 tris / lights vs the shot-list budget,
  LOD1 ≤ 25 % of LOD0, coarsest ≤ 4k tris; totals (LOD0 ≤ 1.2 M tris, ≤ 48 MB, ≤ 4096 lights, ≤ 2000
  authored trees); seating (no floating, buried ≤ max(50 % of the part, the kit SINK of 20 m)); valid material keys; double-build determinism.
- **Bookmark + shot-list gates** (tools/check/bookmarks.ts) — `data/tour/shotlist.json` coverage and film
  length (180–240 s); per landmark `<id>-close` within ±35 % of heroKm with subject ≥ 25 % of frame height,
  ≥ 60 % visible, top-of-frame void ≤ 1 %, void ≤ 3 %, sky ≤ 45 %, clear line of sight; `<id>-wide` when
  contextKm is set (extent ≥ places.json wideShotPxTarget). Both gate files are ERRORS for landmarks at
  shot-list `"status": "s3"` (or declaring `lodPx`), warnings otherwise.
- **Film gates** (tools/check/film.ts, part of `pnpm check`; `node --import tsx tools/check/film.ts [--table]
  [--cues file] [--sync-shotlist]`) — structural errors (schema, beats alternate, refs resolve, legs chain,
  route points / offsets / shot-list segment routes valid, event channels in the gate table, length in range,
  look ids switch at weight 0, tod monotone, caption fades fit their window, compile twice = same hash) and the
  route report (0 self-crossings, 0 kinks > 120°, float ≤ 0.3 km). Sampled at 8 / 24 Hz — warnings while the
  timeline is `draft`, ERRORS once `locked` (picture lock): clearance, speed, view rotation, jerk, zoom rate,
  route head visible in moves (on screen and not behind terrain), the board edge in moves (`visibleTopVoid`),
  labels judged by the TitleSystem's own placement (`anchorPoint`, `subjectVisible`, title-safe; a head diamond
  may sit down to −0.85), probe voids, deck height, tod rate, sunlit share of each hold's subject, LOD changes
  inside holds. `--sync-shotlist` writes the film length, segment seconds / tod / distance mix and hold subjects
  into `data/tour/shotlist.json` (formatting kept); `--cues` exports the music cue sheet.
- **Camera probe v2** (tools/check/probe.ts + the cameras.ts CLI) — ray classes terrain / water / sky /
  void (studio backdrop) / edge (strata cut face), top-of-frame void, near foreground, line of sight, and
  the subject's projected px (build bounds ∪ the landmark's raising stamps) with visibility. CLI modes:
  ONLY / OVR / SEARCH / OTHERS / SHOT / SHOTS (file or set) / JSON / LAKES / RINGS / SLAB (`ASPECT=2.4`
  frames the slab at another aspect; shots from `shots.json` + `shots.d/`). Node world loads wait for
  ≥ 1 GB free RAM.
- `tools/check/stamploss.ts [id…]` — where the river guard bites a landmark's stamps (totals and the
  largest corrected cells with the nearest river). `tools/bake/overlay.py` — CT-1980 geography overlay QA
  against `data/qa/ct1980-points.json` (CPU, the bake's uv env).

## Geography pipeline (Westeros; tools/geo + tools/bake)
Westeros has no DEM or GIS layers, so the project makes both from the user's map images. Nothing traced is
committed: images, vectors, the overlay page and the calibration report all live in the gitignored
`data/source/` (`MOW_SOURCE_DIR` in worktrees). Committed: the map **profiles** (`tools/geo/maps/<id>.json`,
coordinates and thresholds only), `places.json`, `regions.geojson` and `world.json`.

```

- **Sheet ↔ map km** (`vectorize.Sheet`): the base sheet *defines* the frame. Its scale comes from the
  Wall's length: the pixel distance from Westwatch to Eastwatch equals 300 mi. Its origin is the frame crop's
  bottom-left. A further sheet is pinned to that frame by a least-squares affine from ≥ 3 control points on
  known places (`pnpm geo georef --map <id>`, stored as `affine` in its profile with residuals).
- **Vectorize** (`tools/geo/vectorize.py`): the docstring lists every step.
  - **Water:** blue-grey colour rules, plus a teal rule for the Gods Eye.
  - **Sea:** flood from the frame border; Essos is dropped east of `exclude.essosX`; an islet must pass a paint test, which rejects labels and crests.
  - **Lakes:** opening, then small holes filled.
  - **Rivers:** skeleton → graph → gap bridging → orientation toward the sea or a lake.
  - **Terrain:** a QDA classifier on blurred Lab colour, texture and stroke-density features gives forests, marsh (kept only near `marsh.keepNear`), mountain / hill polygons and `relief.npz`.
  - **Labels:** every feature is label M with `src` = the map id. Range peak heights from the anchors are label I.
- **Overlay** (`tools/geo/overlay.py`): the review page. The sheet carries toggleable SVG layers and an opacity slider; hovering a feature shows its name, label and peak. `composite.png` is the flattened copy.
  The user judges the trace here. Corrections go into the profile, never into hand-traced lines.
- **Calibration** (`places.calibrate`): every ledger `distance` / `length` claim between two placed points
  becomes a residual against the Wall scale (`calibration.json`). The sheet's own scale bar is reported
  alongside it.
- **Synthesis** (`tools/bake/bake/synth.py`, `world.json → synth`):
  - **Uplift:** from `relief.npz` (range bodies), plus low plains uplift.
  - **Stream power:** solved at equilibrium on a `workKmPerPixel` grid (n = 1, dt → ∞: hᵢ = h_rcv + dᵢ·U / A^m), with priority-flood receivers (numba). Traced river cells are forced receivers, so the valleys follow the map.
  - **Range gains:** grouped by range name at the 99.5th percentile to meet each range's peakM.
  - **Summits** (`synth.summits`): lower bounds met by local uplift. Hard `constraints` come from verified ledger heights only.
  - **Finish:** upsampling, ridged detail scaled by the local relief, a gully pass, a talus limit (`talusDeg`), the inland rise (keeps lowlands off the beach shading), and the sea shelf and floor.
  - **Determinism:** seeded from `seeds.world`. The report goes to `data/baked/cache/synth_report.json`.
- **Source layer** (`tools/bake/bake/source.py`): reads the GeoJSON layers (km → metres) so the inherited bake runs unchanged. Missing layers are empty, and empty frames keep object-dtype columns. `stamp()` keys the cache on the layer files' digests.
- **Hydro on a traced network:** unprofiled lines (skeleton loops) are marked absorbed, and `into` references are re-pointed past absorbed lines. The geometry gates in `tools/check/world.ts` are warnings while the bake is coarser than 0.5 km/px.

## Canon ledger (data/canon, tools/canon)
- `books.json`: book ids and ranks (the novels and novellas, then *The Lands of Ice and Fire*, then *The World of Ice & Fire* and the other companions). It also holds the label meanings and the time slice (298 AC).
- `subjects.json`: every planned landmark, range, river, region and slice fact (88), grouped north / west / south / realm.
- `claims/<group>.json`: one claim per fact.
  - Fields: `{id, subjects, kind, claim, label T|M|C|I, cites [{book, chapter, find[]}], value?, use[], status draft|verified|corrected|disputed, notes?, conflict?, basis?}`.
  - `data/canon/README.md` holds the full schema, the kinds and the values.
  - `find` holds at most 3 short search keys of at most 5 words each. A key locates the passage in the reader's own copy and never quotes it.
- `pnpm canon`: validates the schema and coverage (every subject has at least one claim) and checks that each claim's label agrees with its sources. It also runs inside `pnpm check`.
- `pnpm canon --index`: indexes the corpus at `MOW_CORPUS_DIR` (.txt / .md / .html / .epub, with a minimal zip reader). The corpus is the user's own copies of the published books and is never committed.
  - The indexer refuses *The Winds of Winter* previews and generated prose.
- `pnpm canon --verify [--apply]`: checks that every key of a citation occurs in one chapter of the cited book, and sets `verified` only then. `--find <text>` searches the corpus; `--selftest` tests the verifier.
- The bake uses claims only when they are `verified`, and then only as hard heights (`synth.constraints`).
  Drafts may feed `synth.summits` lower bounds, which carry their ledger id.

## Westeros changes to the engine
- **Adapter limits:** `Engine` requests the adapter's `maxTextureDimension2D` / buffer limits (16384 on the RTX 5090). `World.load` throws when a baked raster exceeds them. `CAMERA_FAR_KM` is 60000 for the 4700 km board.
- **Software WebGPU (cloud sessions):** `?softgpu=1` (set by the capture tools under `MOW_SOFTWARE_GPU=1`, with `MOW_CHROME` as the browser) allows a fallback adapter.
  - Shims for Chromium 141 SwiftShader (`src/dev/softgpu.ts`): the identity texture-view swizzle is dropped, and the foliage foam 3D texture is skipped (its `writeTexture` fails there).
  - Renders made this way are geometry checks, not looks.
- **Terrain:** the CDLOD vertex xz is clamped to the frame, and CDLOD skips nodes beyond its east / south edges (the root tiles overhang the 2640 × 4700 km frame).
- **Places:** `PlaceDef` gains `label` and `map`. The volcano look keys on `VOLCANO_PLACE = 'dragonmont'`, which has no lava flows yet.
- **Vegetation:** forest channels are named in `world.json → forests.channels`: R haunted forest, G wolfswood, B unused, A southern woods (Kingswood, Rainwood).
  - `placement.ts` has the Westeros fertile and barren region tables.
- **Landmarks:** only the kit and the system remain; Phase 3 adds the 24 Westeros folders.
